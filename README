Rails 3.1 _ids Bug

When adding an association using `_ids = [association_ids]` for a has_many through relationship, ActiveRecord throws a
RecordInvalid error if one of the association_id records does not validate.  When used with a nested form, the update action
will not render the edit action when `object.update_attributes` fails.

Setup:
1. Install the bundled gems and rake the database
2. Run `Classroom.setup_data` in the console to add the default data

Reproduce In Console:
1. Run `Classroom.add_invalid_teacher_to_classroom`

Reproduce In Browser:
1. Navigate to `/classrooms/1/edit`
2. Check the Teachers box for ` Teacher ids 2`
3. Click `Update Classroom`

Simple Form is used as a convenience to create the check box fields.
